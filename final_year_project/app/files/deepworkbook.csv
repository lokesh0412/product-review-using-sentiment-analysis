A word of caution: deep work is not easy. It's not merely just focussing heard and doing good work, it's about training your mind to learn hard things fast.

Some of the advice sounds ludicrous at first, like learning the card trick, but makes more sense later.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.in/Deep-Work-Focused-Success-Distracted/product-reviews/0349413681/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_23?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=23&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The 4 rules of Deep Work
Rule #1: Work Deeply
Rule #2: Embrace Boredom
Rule #3: Quit Social Media/Distractions
Rule #4: Drain the Shallows
Other Important takeaways from the book
Focusing on one important task at a time- that’ll advance your position is true and pure deep work.
Deep work is a skill that allows you to quickly master complicated information and produce better results in less time.
You lose the sense of time when you’re working on engaging things.
Deep work leads to quick happiness and advances.
If you don’t produce, you won’t thrive- no matter how skilled or talented you are.
When you switch from some Task A to another Task B, your attention doesn’t immediately follow—a residue of your attention remains stuck thinking about the original task. This residue gets especially thick if your work on Task A was unbounded and of low intensity, before you switched, but even if you finish Task A before moving on, your attention remains divided for a while
Clarity about what matters provides clarity about what does not.
Deep work training must involve two goals: improving your ability to concentrate intensely and overcoming your desire for distraction.
We spend much of our day on autopilot—not giving much thought to what we’re doing with our time.
The differences between expert performers and normal adults reflect a life-long period of deliberate effort to improve performance in a specific domain.","4.0 out of 5 stars","",""

It would have helped if there were salient points jotted along with the text. You lead an anxious path before the mystery in the prose is revealed. Nevertheless, the author does make you think. The extended annotations and connotations give ample time to set your frame of mind and derive your own inferences and interpretations. The author strongly backs up every statement. It feels like reading a research topic and then also digging into the references at the same time while going through the text. So it does feel like meandering through the garden of references while jogging through the various statements the author makes. If you enjoy this style, it's great since it reinforces your thinking and understanding of the concepts. But for some of the lighter readers who generally take the authors claims for granted and dump input into their brains without crossexamination and thorough dissection, this might seem like TMI.

I felt like it was too much information at times but what I liked was that there are ideas that are novel and refreshing that are not routine. Its not like a self improvement book. Sometimes you are left with a choice as the solution that suits your personality. So it can be open ended at times. On the whole I feel the book does open up a new can of thinking worms depending on how inquisitive you are. Once you absorb the ideas then it feels like any other book where you don't really see results until you put the ideas into practice.

A decent buy. No regrets.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.in/Deep-Work-Focused-Success-Distracted/product-reviews/0349413681/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_22?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=22&reviewerType=all_reviews"

His job demands serious ideas and content generation. Something he can do only if he devotes serious amount of time and attention to the task.
The author has first posited his argument of why deep work is essential for success in today's winner takes all knowledge economy. Having set the context he then proceeds to deliberate various ideas for carving out chunks of time where you can do serious work. He also suggests ways you can optimize your non working time like walking for lunch etc. His ideas and explanation for scheduling a day into chunks for deep work and shallow work is very useful. Unless you make a schedule and assign slots for serious deep work you are going to emails and whats app again and again. Unfortunately out modern corporate are not conducive for such  serious deep work. Open offices, constant chatter around you, phones ringing,  stream of useless meetings, conf calls, people just barging in, manager calling you to send some data or report for his equally useless review call. For these people this book is not going to help much.
But if you work on your own or own a business then this is the book for you. Apply the methods suggested and gain benefits. Actually most of what he says is commonsense. But a common sense is not common anymore and that is why we see and need such self help books.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.in/Deep-Work-Focused-Success-Distracted/product-reviews/0349413681/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_24?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=24&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I realised that this book was not that great at all. This book is good for someone who needs a self help kind of a approach or if you are in stage in you life where you need a lot of advice, However if you are in a stage in your life where you had gathered some experience then this book has no value. The author has basically collected a set of anecdotal reference from several places and put it together, in the form of a book. His research are not solid and they simply cross reference several individuals in a way that they palaver to his thinking. It creates not connect to the read and at time feels like cacophony of idea put together to say a simple thing. This look is a mere figment of imagination of the author. The author himself is a research scientist and just juxtaposes his working style on the life style of people. This book can seriously damage thinking of a young impressionable,  adult who will believe that this use case applies in all areas of life but it doesn't. If you have Business, a job or other areas of work then following this book is chore you wouldn't want to add to your lifestyle.

While the strategies appear reasonable, I wonder if Newport's background in academia and lack of work experience elsewhere affects his ability to truly understand at a personal level why depth is challenging. Often, he appears dismissive of concerns raised by people outside his realm. The other grouse i have is that Newport writes solely for an American audience. While it's perhaps unfortunate that most research on human behaviour and productivity is done in the US, it'd have made for a more convincing story if he had included more examples of depth from other countries and cultures.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.in/Deep-Work-Focused-Success-Distracted/product-reviews/0349413681/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_27?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=27&reviewerType=all_reviews"

It doesn't offer any life-changing advice or grandiose, unreal stories which are usually contained in such books. What is does is to offer solid advice and REAL steps in achieving goals. It's not an easy read; not really a page turner but if you can internalize the message given in it, it can be greatly beneficial. Another positive aspect is; the author backs his claims with real data, rather than shallow claims.

It might SEEM new if you constantly live in a social-media-frenzy world. But if you read a lot of good self-help books, you might have understood the value of focus and deep work and this book is a shallow repetition of all that is said before. There are many books on mastery and improving your craft, this one, it seems is specifically aimed at the millennial generation or people addicted to the internet and social media.

There is some good categorization of deep work, how to choose the one that fits your work and temperament and how to schedule your day, but the research seems largely taken from other popular books. If this is a topic that interests you, I suggest you to read Essentialism by Greg McKeown and Flow by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi which are far deeper than Deep Work. (I know!).

The gist:
1. The quality of our life depends on the quality of our attention.
2. Quit social media.
3. Do meaningful (deep) work - for a specific length of time.
4. Don't be available to everyone all the time. Choose what is important to you.
5. Schedule everything. Even the free time.
- Worth reading once.

The book stresses on time management and will power management. Though, someone lacking in motivation may find the work a little incomplete as it does not address the issue much.

Most self-help books (if not all) masquarades poor advice and wishful thinking as a path to self-progress. Every now and then I torture myself reading self-help books to reinforce my above thoughts about self-help books. Luckily I came across this book as strong recommendation from a twitter account which I really value a lot. And I'm glad that I took the recommendation.

Deep Work is a common sense book than a self-help book. The crux of the book is that there are two kind of work we do. One is Deep work and the other is shallow work. Deep work is rare and hard. Shallow work is easy and ubiquitous.

What is Deep Work? Deep work is concentrating on a cognitively demanding work with zero distractions to produce quality work. Its demanding and helps provide valuable things to society that are hard to replicate or replace.

What Shallow work? Any work we do on auto-pilot. Replying emails , social media presence etc. These work are easy to replace and not valued much in society.

The book is dividend into two parts. Part I is about why Deep work matter and its scientific backing. Part II is how to achieve Deep work.

Part I doesn't have to try hard to convince us about the internet chipping away our ability to concentrate and contemplate. And provides all the necessary studies and research on internet and its effects on attention. Most of the critique are well ground and rational, and definitely not a luddite rant on the internet.

Part II is how to achieve Deep Work.

Discusses on what type of Deep work philosophy to choose.
Ritualising Deep work: Identify Location and time to do deep work. Adhere to rules and process to deep work. (like no internet)
4DX fundamentals: Focus unimportant things, Act on measures, Keep a scorecard, Create accountability.
Embrace Boredom:Don't take break from distraction. Instead take breaks from Focus. Schedule your internet usage. Structure your deep thinking.
Quit Social Media.
Drain the Shallows: Schedule your day in blocks in advance to focus on Deep work.

Although it follows the typical science/self-help format with familiar paragraphs like 'The Study conducted by University of X researchers on group of people in Y of the age Z in ABC environment agrees with my thesis', this is a potent work with strong common sense solutions to the ubiquitous problem of shallow work. My thoughts on self-help books remains unchanged. However I would highly recommend this book.","5.0 out of 5 stars","",""

Although most of us know the above case but struggled to implement it in our daily routine lives, Cal Newport deciphers that how most knowledge workers nowadays ignore that how distractions from social messaging services, social networks, e-mails, infotainment sites, and others have hindered our ability to perform deep work which is what that really matters in our professional and personal lives.

The author argued that deep work is essential for everyone who wants to move forward in their professional careers, as in this new information age only those who will thrive who have an ability to acquire new skills till mastery level in the least time possible. He reinforces the above argument by explaining how job scenario is changing with emerging computer and robots encroachment at low-level/mundane jobs through case studies, leaving us with the choice whether we want to thrive or survive. For the former case author has purposed many ways in the second part of the book like how to go about scheduling your day, how to reply/send an e-mail while reducing the in-numerous chit chat e-mails along your professional and personal life, to extract as much distracted free time for yourself, your ideas, and your work with deep work at the core of it all.

Cal has also eloquently suggested how to do deep work while working in groups/teams that exists pervasively in businesses nowadays, while at the same time convincing us how to maintain a delicate balance between group/teamwork and your own work which will help you in moving forward at an accelerated pace towards your professional goals along with a feeling of gratification.

This book unveils unambiguously how precious and important deep work has now become not just in order to thrive but to live a life with a purpose and meaning.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.in/Deep-Work-Focused-Success-Distracted/product-reviews/0349413681/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_21?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=21&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The ideas are not really difficult to implement but our mind is so used to craving for distraction that it becomes difficult to continue in this deep work mode. And that is where the strength of the book lies in. It not only lists down the steps needed but already predicts what kind of obstructions will come up and how to handle those. Cal has really made it fool proof system if you can vow to follow it.

To those saying that it is repetitive in the first part, I believe it is really necessary to convince us in all ways possible. Because everyone knows deep work is good just like everyone knows exercise and eating balanced diet are good but no one does them. You really need to be convinced in order to make permanent lifestyle change.","5.0 out of 5 stars","",""
