The reason I bought this is because it is for a teen ager who spends the nights with friends and I thought it would be nice to have to protect the kindle.  Cannot say if she likes it since she lives away from us.  But we did purchase a similar item in the past and was very satisfied.  I do plan to purchase two more for the other two kindle.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Kindle-Standing-Leather-Origami/product-reviews/B00DR0BOSC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_5?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=5&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Able to easily use the on/off button and volume buttons while in the case.  Also, the audio is not muffled while encased (sounds great!).  Appreciate being able to stand in portrait or landscape position.  A really great feature is that when the flap is closed it automatically puts the Kindle to sleep, and when opened the Kindle awakes; love it!  I have set up the Kindle so I can listen to Pandora (sometimes with noise cancelling earplugs), read a book or the news, and enjoy a cup of coffee.

We were hesitant at first because it looked bulky and too rigid to be convenient to use. However, after using it for several months I can confidently report it was the best option for me. I often use my Kindle for ""hands off"" reading like recipes and repair manuals. The origami stand is a perfect accessory for either portrait or landscape documents; and it is sturdy enough that when I need to navigate it doesn't fall over when I touch the controls on the screen (Big Plus). The durability is second to none. I put my kindle in the outside pocket of a thin carry-on bag. Forgetting it was there I checked the bag at the airport. I watched them treat the bag as expected while it loaded the plane, came off the plane and then was pounded to death by other luggage on the baggage claim carousel, but you could tell I wasn't worried because I had a slight grin on my face showing I was confident that the origami would protect my Kindle - which I am currently using to type this review.  I highly recommend this product with confidence and satisfaction!","5.0 out of 5 stars","",""

I agree with majority of the positive reviews, it is a good looking case, I like like the color and texture.

However I also found the same problem a lot of other reviewers have experienced, the random powering on and off, the magnetic case cover not shutting the unit down when closed, or turning it on when opening.

Me being me, I looked the case over and decided to ""repair"" the cause of the problem myself.  I know this voided the warranty and I will not be able to return this case, but I like the case enough to accept that outcome.

The root issue is that the power ""button"" in the case protrudes slightly too much inside the case, making intermittent contact with the power button on the Kindle itself, causing all of the aforementioned complaints.  So I relieved the case of this problematic plastic button (more like a rivet, it is two pieces) and am very much pleased with the result.

Opening and closing the cover actually does exactly what it was designed to do now every single time, no exceptions.  So far I have not needed to press the power button, if I ever do I'll just use a pen/pencil tip, or take it out of the case.","4.0 out of 5 stars","",""

Bratcher","Nice cover, but overpriced","December 25, 2013","This is a very practical cover for the Kindle Fire HD. It snugly holds the unit and protects it while giving adequate access to ports and buttons (volume and power). It's not bulky at all. And the ""origami"" nature of it makes it handy to stand the unit up. It automatically powers up the unit when you open it, which is a nice feature.

On the negative side, to call it ""leather"" is a bit of a stretch. There's some leather and a lot of vinyl/plastic. And a cover simply shouldn't cost more than $30 in my mind, unless it's loaded with gold leaf. It's also slightly ""homely"" from an aesthetic perspective. So I give it 4 stars instead of 5 for being overpriced (note that the price has come way down since I made this review - at $18 it's an excellent deal all the way round).","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Kindle-Standing-Leather-Origami/product-reviews/B00DR0BOSC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_12?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=12&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The origami feature though is pretty amazing, and is well worth a 5 star rating if I didn't have kids using them.  Will take a look at the OtterBox that looks like it will offer much more protection to the screen when the cover is open.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Kindle-Standing-Leather-Origami/product-reviews/B00DR0BOSC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_12?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=12&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Best case for propping up kindle vertically or horizontally.  Kindle will stay propped up due to magnets.

Slim design.

Con (and a very annoying con):  the power button is located right under a person's left hand.  Even without the case accidentally pressing it is a problem.  With the case, the power button is accidentally pressed at least every five minutes.  A prompt appears on screen, so you can hit cancel, but it is highly annoying. I have learned to hold my kindle in such a way that I don't press the button, but it is not an ergonomic way.  When my young daughter uses my kindle, she hits the button constantly and it is very frustrating.  I have to remove the case, which defeats the purpose of its protection and she can't prop up the device to watch a movie.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Kindle-Standing-Leather-Origami/product-reviews/B00DR0BOSC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews"

LIeb","Don't buy this tablet","August 28, 2015","This is not worth buying.  I began having problems with it turning itself off occasionally after a few months.  I finally called Amazon when it shut itself off as soon as it reached 50% power every time and they had me run a cleaner which erased all of my downloads and game progress.  I downloaded everything again .  It then started shutting itself off again.  Next they had me do a factory reset. I lost everything again Finally, they replaced it with the same model.  I had that one 2-3 months and it began shutting itself down for no reason. It also froze pretty frequently. They again replaced it with the same model. Since my original warranty will be up next month, I asked what I'm supposed to do when the new one started shutting itself down.  I was told by a snotty young man named Anthony that I had no way of knowing what would happen. I've had the new one about a week. The last two days, it has shut itself off when I am in the middle of something.  While I appreciate Amazon replacing my defective device, giving me another defective device is not helpful.  Amazon is my go to store for everything. I am very disappointed with this product and with Amazon's response.  It appears that they will just stall me with defective devices until my warranty is up and then expect I will buy another one.  That won't happen.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Kindle-Standing-Leather-Origami/product-reviews/B00DR0BOSC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I thought my computer was ruined, What was really going on is that the magnet in this case was confusing my laptop into thinking I had closed the laptop, and the screen would go blank until I removed the kindle. It really is more of a nuisance than a help. It's hard to get to the volume control because of this case's design, and the case tends to fall apart and fold during reading/holding. I plan to replace it. I was going to give this case 2 stars, however, I gave it 3 stars because the standing feature is nice and works, which is what this case is, I guess, meant for. Holds firm, doesn't fall apart while standing, very sturdy when standing. I can tap away on the screen and it doesn't budge.","3.0 out of 5 stars","",""

Though the cover feels more like textured plastic than leather. That's a disappointment. I buy leather because I like it's durability, and it's feel.

I have found that I need to be very careful not to accidently touch the power button! Sometimes I've been fortunate enough to get the screen shot that asks me if I want to power off my Kindle HD first. Odd that the sound buttons don't seem to be sensitive at all. Maybe it's just how I handle mine?

As for positioning the Amazon Kindle HD Standing Leather Origami Case; I've only used it one afternoon at my desk, in the horizontal position. That worked pretty well. Just where and how the Kindle HD sits is pre-determined due to the molded lines in the case. I did try to stand it up right (as a paperback). I could not find any spot or angel that would allow the Kindel HD to be stand upright. The case is to flimsy for this purpose.

The back is flimsy in general. It's not a case I would pick if I had another better option.","3.0 out of 5 stars","",""

Another thing that I've just noticed, as the Kindle gets so perfectly fit inside it, absolutely no way it can fall off, you can use the case to put your Kindle, for example, in any vertical metallic surface, and the magnets are so strong, it will stay there.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Kindle-Standing-Leather-Origami/product-reviews/B00DR0BOSC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_39?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=39&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Unfortunately when the Kindle was placed inside of it, the Kindle instantly shutdown.  When I tried to turn the Kindle back on, it would not come on.  It would show only a black and white Kindle Fire logo on the screen and then shutdown.  If the Kindle was removed from the case, the Kindle would work fine.  Upon inspection, I realized what the problem was.  The area of the cover covering the power button is slightly depressed so when the Kindle is in the cover, the cover was constantly pressing down on the power button.  They need to redesign the case to prevent this from occurring.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Kindle-Standing-Leather-Origami/product-reviews/B00DR0BOSC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews"

It's what I wanted iPad's SmartCover to be, but Apple failed miserably with their botched attempt at tablet protection -- this one is really better. My Origami Case saw some abuse: dust, sand, a bit of rain -- and it's regularly carried in my bag being stuffed there together with steel items. So far it holds good and protects my Fire HD from certain death in such circumstances.
My only complaint here is about weight/bulkiness -- I'd like it to be slimmer and lighter, but I'm not sure this is possible without switching to titan/carbon and ditching leather, and I'd not consider non-leather case anyway.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Kindle-Standing-Leather-Origami/product-reviews/B00DR0BOSC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews"

HOWEVER there's an engineering flaw.  The power button is too close/tight and reboots the system over and over.  I found a fix.  You can exercise the button from the inside out, as it has a bit of spring and or ""play"".  If that doesn't work, just pop the button out (this is what I did).  True you shouldn't HAVE to do this, but I love the design and hate returning things.  Exercising this button helps a lot;  yet when I pick up the unit from time to time, it would still reboot.  Use a pair of pliers and remove that button (from inside the case), and problem fixed.  ALSO.. you can buy this case by other sellers for $14.99 rather than $49.99 (Amazon's price), and they sell them right here on Amazon too.  Choose another buying option for the cheaper price and get the EXACT same case.","4.0 out of 5 stars","",""

It is still the only case I have ever had on my kindle and I absolutely love it. I love this gorgeous leather case so much, that I don't want to upgrade to a new kindle because they don't make the same case for it. I've looked at other folding cases and they just don't compare to the soft leather feel of this one. It folds perfectly and the magnet in the cover wakes the tablet when you open it and puts it to sleep when you close it. The only thing I don't like about this case is that it leans a slight bit when standing vertically in portrait mode.

Pros - I do like how thin the cover is – it almost feels as though there is nothing covering the Kindle, but the Kindle feels protected at the same time. It does fold so you can view by portrait or landscape. My Kindle did fit well and was very secure inside the case. I had no problems with charging while it was in the case.
Cons – The leather look isn’t exactly how I thought it would be. It almost feels like plastic – I would have done just as well with the cheaper plastic case I think. It was starting to grow on me, but the feel of it just never was right. The origami feature part of it that stands it up seems awfully flimsy to me. I never really got a chance to use that much, so maybe it would have worked fine, but I worry how long in the future it would have lasted. It does go to sleep by itself and back on when you close and open the cover, but only if I was away for a very, very short time. Any longer than that and the device would power itself off and I would have to hit the power button again, and that’s where the major problems started for me. I was not able to turn the Kindle on with the case on. It acts like the case doesn’t quite hit snug enough with the power button – I would have to barely tilt the Kindle out of the cover or take it out altogether in order to turn it on, even though the button looked like it was depressed properly. So basically every time I used it, I had to take it out of the case to turn it on. And the case fits very tightly, so you couldn’t just slip it out easily – it had to be pried out. I had issues with the Kindle trying to power itself off repeatedly while in use…sometimes while holding it (maybe my hand was over the power button – not sure), but other times while it was just sitting on a table downloading. I have had no issues with the Kindle when it’s not in the case with this, and have since bought another type of case and still no issue with this. This is the one thing that finally aggravated me to the point I had to return the product and find a replacement.
Hopefully Amazon will look at the reviews and make changes to this case as I think it is a really good design and could work very well.","2.0 out of 5 stars","",""

I've had the cover for about a week and can't overstate how much I like it. First and foremost it seems to be a very effective protective cover for the relatively fragile Kindle. The fact that it barely adds to the bulk is a big plus as well.  I've had no experience with the erratic off/on as reported in other reviews. It works as advertised.
As an engineer, I can't help but praise the elegance of the design. Seldom have I seen a product as well suited to its intended application as this one.

So after discussing the problem on the amazon.com help chat service I decided to return it and try another one. But the problem is the same. At this point my only options were to again return and replace the case with another origami case or to get a refund.  I got tired of feeling frustrated about the thing and how much it costs and that it appears to be the only good leather based option for the newest kindle fire :( generation... so I busted the shell-button out and slapped on the case!  Now it works just fine with no powering off problems. Too bad the manufacturers missed such a simple design flaw. Maybe they will fix it soon and then amazon can begin selling those for even more money!  The good news is that when that occurs these original designs will become much cheaper and then you can try out my fix!","1.0 out of 5 stars","",""

But my kindle started resetting itself over and over again. At first, I thought something was wong with the Kindle itself, but then I discovered that the magnets in the cover were magnetizing the whole thing, cover AND Kindle to whatever I put it down on/next to that was metal. Solution? take the cover off, and get a different case. So I did, and for a bit it worked great. Now it's still out of  the case, and it froze. I had to hold the power button down and reset it. Then it started freezeing for about 10-15 sec and then resetting itself. I think the magnetization screwed it up permenatly.

I couldn't be more happier with this product! It does what it says and really protects your Kindle Fire HD. It does have a slight plastic feeling to it but it is leather material through and through. A lot of reviews states that the Kindle Fire HD powers down randomly and resets on its own without anyone ever touching the power button. Rest assured that this has NOT happened to me. I'm glad I didn't let those reviews influence me.

Was told stop using it and return Kindle HD for replacement.  It seems that those who use the Origami case have had similar experience.  Engineers can' f figure out why.  I suggest they look at effect of the strong magnets that hold it into position.

My son, who like me, loves to read fell in love with the kindle. So for Christmas, we decided to purchase one for him. Having loved the kindle case, I knew we would be purchasing the kindle brand for him. In fall, the new kindle fire and kindle origami case was released. The origami is FANTASTIC. It is such an improvement over the previous kindle cover that I am jealous beyond measure. The previous case can slide and have my kindle land flat on the tabletop. I've learned to deal with it, but so wished the origami would fit my kindle. Of course it won't, because the new kindle fire is more square than mine. The origami case sits solid as a rock. I love, love , LOVE it!
