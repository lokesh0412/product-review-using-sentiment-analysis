Some light linening running on the tv screen when i search with alexa voice any song on you tube it will open in other place not on youtube and song search option is very lenghty because we have to search through fire tv remote press every button for every letter. Many apps like airtel tv, jio tv tata sky and many more are not available. Mirroring option is not working properly everytime i connect it disconnect in 10 seconds there is no use of mirror option.

From a product perspective, it is completly lag free in operation unless your installing an app and trying to navigate away from the screen it is little slow. Usually installing the app doesnt take much time so this is not at all a big problem.

Even though the remote makes use of IR blaster for volume control and switch off tv, it is really powerful it doesn't need to be in a straight line of sight with the tv for operation.

Firestick also pairs with my echo dot and works well with the alexa remote as well. So it is super convenient. Overall me & my family is happy with the product.","5.0 out of 5 stars","",""

The power button does not work to on or off anything , I am using Akai LED TV, maybe it works with other TVs I am not sure.

The volume up and volume down do not change the volume they pause the video, Again this is with Akai TV.

Mic works very well.
Alexa great in understanding your accent.
Alexa doing a great job with amazon prime
Alexa knows nothing about local businesses or finding anything for you in the internet.
You can run youtube
Movies run in smooth way most of the time.
You require a good internet to run movies in smooth way else week internet connection specially
internet from Airtel will cause movies to freeze most of the time.

I am giving 3 less stars due to the power button , volume up and volume down buttons.
rest is good enough reason to make you buy it.

However in my case since 3 new extra buttons in the new version not working, the old version would be
a better choice as I will save a thousand bucks or more.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.in/Stick-all-new-Remote-Streaming-Player/product-reviews/B0791YHVMK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Li'l Disappointed.","8 February 2019","- Unlike chromecast, fire tv stick is difficult to operate while streaming from mobile app to firetv. Even to cast mobile screen, I need to go to firetv settings first.
- Mobile & mobile apps doesn't show/detect firetv and vice-versa unlike chromecast.
- Streaming on already installed apps gets hanged frequently even at 50Mbps broadband speed (speed constantly verified on speedtest app by Ookla).
- Alexa voice response is slow.
- Everytime I run FireTv app on mobile, it scans and reconnects TVstick. Doesn't remeber device on app when it's turned ON.
- Even it has remote, voice control and pre-installed apps, it's no match for chromecast. And price too is quite high just for techs used but of very little to no use.
Not happy with it, for me it was waste of my money.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.in/Stick-all-new-Remote-Streaming-Player/product-reviews/B0791YHVMK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I am very much happy with the device. It has all the required features to turn your normal TV into smart. Smooth interface with no lags and compatibility with most of the Apps except the Google Apps. It totally does the job for media viewing experience.

The major gripe for me with the previous version was
1. Requirement to use two remotes.
2. Limited Internal Storage (8GB)

Amazon decided to deal with the first point and without increase in price. The new remote that has IR feature now, can Turn your TV ON/OFF and control the TV Volume. This is a very practical move which should have been included in the previous version.

--------
NOTE:
--------
Do check if your TV supports a Universal Remote for controlling. Not every brand or model does that. So ON/OFF, Volume Control and mute might or might not work.

Supported Famous Apps/Games:
Prime Video, Prime Music, Hotstar, Netflix, Airtel Cinema, Jio Cinema, Zee5, Viu, Youtube (Via thrid party apps), Firefox, Riptide GP2, Asphalt (But storage won't be enough), Crossy Roads Etc

Unsupported Apps:
Google Photos, Google Drive, Facebook, Jio Tv, Airtel Tv, Playstore

Pros:
1. Easy to setup.
2. Intuitive interface with curated content.
3. No stuttering or hangs with good internet speed.
4. Supports Phone Mirroring.
5. Casting support for Prime Videos, Youtube Videos.
6. Option to sideload Apks.
7. Very responsive remote.
8. Remote app available to control from phone.
9. Alexa for voice search.
10. Above all, its a stand alone device unlike chromecast.

Cons:
1. The screencast has a slight lag making it difficult for gaming.
2. Voice search in the remote works only for the content in Prime Video, Youtube and Browser.
3. Not a great game collection.
4. Limited storage and no SD card support.
5. Slow startup times. (Best to not switch off the adapter)
6. No option to add another amazon account. Only one account at a time.

Conclusion: If you are ok with using two remotes, you can buy the previous version that is available at discounted price. But if you don't, then buy this without any hesitation. Either way you will have a great device for your family.

I just wish they increased the internal storage atleast in this version. So one star reduced only for that.","4.0 out of 5 stars","",""

It works amazing than the default TV android engine, it has elevated the viewing experience of TV and I just love it... Alexa and additional volume and power button with infrared support have enhanced the experience further and are essential features to have..

Superb looks,flawless performance and quality that actually exceeds my expectations.
Nothing much to describe.
One can just buy it without any doubts straightaway!!
Just one thing,if Amazon would have provided a good protective cover with it.
I haven't yet found a good quality protective cover for it anywhere.
Shall update again when I find one.
Cheers to Amazon for an awesome product!!!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.in/Stick-all-new-Remote-Streaming-Player/product-reviews/B0791YHVMK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The product is adamant and Amazon decides what we have to watch on TV. I couldn't find most of the Indian media TV apps in this device store.Some news channels are not even playing after repeated reinstallation, for example Times Now App. Even after i opted to watch those News channels on firefox, still not able to screen it on TV says unrecognized media content. This is a very disappointing product and i would like to know the refund process.
