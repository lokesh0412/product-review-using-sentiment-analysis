This machine is a pretty decent entry level gaming rig and will play most titles. Utility beyond gaming is limited. Battery life depends on the kind of game you play. Demanding games will drain the battery in less than an hour but RTS and strategy titles like stellaris will give slightly longer battery time.

Heating is a slight issue because of the weird internal design of the laptop, but nothing too significant. I'd suggest you buy a cooling pad to ensure extra airflow if you plan on 3-4+ hours of heavy GPU+CPU intensive tasks like gaming. However, if you're getting it for 90K+, go for the Asus GL503 for 97K.

On another note, if you want to manage heat, download Intel XTU and undervolt the CPU. IT DOES NOT VOID YOUR WARRANTY.

Display clarity is excellent for normal usage, however I am bit less impressed with the keyboard. i7 8750h , 8 GB ram and dual cooling fans allow lot of headroom for running CPU-intensive tasks for moderate duration, if you are a software developer or a guy planning to run productivity tools then this laptop is the best bargain in the given price range. Laptop throttles itself while running on battery (to preserve battery) hence if you want to extract the maximum power, for example during gaming, then keep the AC supply plugged in. Battery life is equal to or better than several gaming laptops in the comparable price range, expect 1.5-2.5 hours of continuous use while on battery.

This laptop will run most of the same applications your desktop does however this one is certainly not a complete replacement for your desktop PC. CPU runs moderately hot at 5-10% workload (45-55 degree Celsius) while my desktop CPU sits ""cool"" at 19-30 degrees at similar workload and one must ensure sufficient airflow through the bottom during moderate to heavy use, don't place this laptop in your lap or in bed if you don't want to experience overheating and thermal throttling issues.","5.0 out of 5 stars","",""

Hands down the best price: performance ratio that could be there","19 October 2018","I got this beast during a sale at a net price of 69,000. At the time of writing this it costs approximately 89,000.
For the price I got it at, there was no question of finding a better choice. There simply wasn't one.

The specs are absolutely fantastic. It can handle games like FIFA and Rocket League at max settings and some AAA titles at high settings with ease. The SSD which, as a standalone product is one of the lowest tier models around, does help in application boot times and OS boot time. Transfer speeds are so-so.

The display is in my opinion the 2nd best in class, only to be beaten by the Dell Inspiron 7000 series, but that's notably more expensive. Its bright, very good colour balance, and the matte finish make it quite pleasing to look at. This is good enough, I believe for media creation and editing work as the colours are crisp and cover a good segment of the Adobe RGB spectrum. The specs make it a great mobile workstation.

The build is generally quite nice , with good quality plastic on the outside and a sturdy base. The keyboard is quite good and typing on it is a good experience. It has well spaced keys, with a nice typing pressure. They're slightly on the softer side and are quiet too. The trackpad is a good size and is very good to use. It works with Windows' inbuilt touchpad settings. No nonsense 3rd party drivers and customisation software to deal with.

The sound quality is also not that good, with fairly ordinary speakers. But this is to be expected since it isn't a full fledged gaming machine. The presence of Dolby software however makes for good output through headphones.

The hexacore i7 is a joy to work with. Very snappy and quite power efficient. Which sadly doesn't help the overall battery life, due to the presence of a desktop grade graphics card. However, if someone is looking for battery life, then a gaming laptop of any kind is the wrong category to browse. For me it's as expected.

The laptop is well equipped with ports and even includes a USB 3.1 type-c port, which is great for a bit of future-proofing and high speed data transfer.

The cons are that the cooling system isn't well designed. Over time it will impact system performance and will require more maintenance than other laptops of this category to ensure smooth function. You will find laptops from MSI and Asus with much better cooling design, but for slightly higher prices, & you will be giving up on display quality.
The keyboard backlight has only an on and off function. Brightness control would have been a very good option. It's great for the day but too bright for dark rooms.

The frame of the screen doesn't have any metal in it so it's quite flexible. That helps to reduce weight but causes a lot of flex when being bent. So added care is needed while handling it or loading it in a backpack.

For a model running in 2018, it has too few USB 3.0 ports. Even the type-c port is of an old standard. This bit is just sad.

But, for me, the price at which I got it, I'm simply in no position to complain. It's a phenomenal bang for my buck. I would suggest buyers to keep an eye out for it's price, in case it falls again.","4.0 out of 5 stars","",""

Pros:
1.the i7-8750h can easily handle all your heavy tasks like editing and photoshop considering it has 6core/12threads compared to the last gen 7700hq
2.the 1050ti is more than capable for playing AAA titles at more than 60 fps at high-medium settings

Cons:
1.the laptop fan when under heavy usage makes quite audible. But it is nothing that bothering
2.with all the specs it has 8gb ram which is more than enough for daily usage and gaming. But there might be a few who would require more for editing and photoshop.
3.the screen is an ips display which is great but is 60hz. Newer models of other brands and even acer predator are coming with 120hz

If this laptop is available at a lower price then go for it. If you want to buy it at mrp it is still not a bad choice but there are a bit better options(screen 120hz ones) for a few bucks more.

Got it at a steal price...","18 July 2018","Ordered the laptop on Prime Day sale. Laptop was delivered within 2 days, kudos to Amazon for being super fast as always. I got a great deal on this laptop, the effective cost for me is about 55k (Prime Day Sale 69k - Exchange 10k - Bank Cashback 4k), the current price at the time of writing this review is showing as 93k, which means I saved close to 38k... Thanks to Amazon! Now coming back to initial impressions :

Pros :
* Performance is great, 8th Gen i7, GTX 1050Ti with an SSD helps a lot. (A restart completes within 30 seconds)
* Build quality seems decent and feels like it will last for few years.
* Red accents give it a sporty look, especially the back-lit keyboard is a treat to my eyes.
* Acer's NitroSense, QuickAccess and CareCenter are very helpful tools which allows you to control the Fan Speed, Performance, Cleanup etc
* At the price I bought, its the most VFM laptop. All other laptops with similar specs cost a lot high and feel very expensive compared to this.

Cons :
* The laptop does heat up on playing games. I tried CS:GO at High settings and the CPU touched 98deg while the GPU touched 75deg. The fans were running loud but didn't improve the temperature as much as I'd like it to. (Sitting in a AC room with 22deg temp)
* There were quite a bit of bloatware installed which I had to uninstall before I could do anything else.
* The 128GB SSD doesn't feel adequate as I have already filled up 80GB out of available 118GB storage space within few hours only by installing very minimum applications that I needed.
* The keys on the keyboard are very odd, the layout isn't the best. I tend to press Home instead of Del often. The arrow keys are very thin and feel congested.
* The battery feels inadequate for this laptop, Acer could've given a battery with more capacity.

Other Notes :
* I loved the Laptop's box, Acer did a good job in designing it.
* The power button is flushed with the keyboard layout. (Top right corner key)
* Although the laptop has red accents at multiple places, it has a rather strange purple accent within the power inlet and at power adapter pin end.
* Finally at the current price of 93K, I'd look at MSI or Asus ROG series instead of Nitro series since they are more gaming focused.","5.0 out of 5 stars","",""

you will not get other product that has core i7 + Nvidia gtx 1050 Ti +120 gb ssd combination for the price of 75k.
(edit- one Asus TUF has better configuration on 75k range at the time of writing this )

so if you're sensitive about price, go for it..

plastic body, doesn't feel sturdy..this the main cons. Also I like to point out display is only 60 hz. that means maximum fps you get is limited to 60.

battery life is meh.. it'll last around 3 hour or so.. but this is irrelevant as gaming laptop are meant to be plugged In to power.

sound is meh, this a laptop not a speaker..

overall good.. yes, fan can be little tiny loud.. but who cares..

go for it.

ah yes you can upgrade your rams and what not without warranty void..","4.0 out of 5 stars","",""
